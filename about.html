                            <p>I'm Ryle, sometimes people around me also calls me Baron. I lived in Brgy. Curva Bongabon Nueva Ecija. Programming isn't for me but I'm still trying to learn it and enhance my skill with it. I'm thinking that my course is not for me because I really like to be a commercial plane pilot but we cannot afford it so I pick Information Technology because I feel like I'm good at it even though I don't like it very much. But I like designing like websites so I'm trying my best in order to make a beautiful webpage.<br><br> 

                                I'am currently studying at <abbr title="Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology">NEUST</abbr> where I learned some skills that I have right now. For now I know the basics of C++, HTML, and CSS in coding and in networking I know how to create a straigh-through and crossover cable, file sharing, and using packet tracer. Today I love designing using canva and also I love designing web.</p>
